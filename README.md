This is a very simple hobby web app that I initially wrote up very quickly and have been tweaking occassionally since.

Users enter the webpage and can choose to "Enter the coffee shop" which will prompt them for camera permission.
If permission is granted, an image from their camera is streamed to the other coffee shop users at one frame per second.
There is no audio. This is meant to simulate working in a coffeeshop, where you are getting perceived but interaction is not expected.
For fun, I added a button that will put a little coffee icon on the user's image for a few minutes, which is also streamed to other users.

This can run easily in Heroku but I have cancelled it since it is no longer free.
